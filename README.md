Hello. 

This project is a pixel-art drawing project that I created using React. 
I wanted to test the power of React in this project. I used React Hooks and a little bit of jQuery in the project. 

- Unfortunately, I am no longer continuing this project, but you can still view my project on GitHub pages or view my code on GitHub

GitHub Pages: canesen7.github.io/react-pixel-app
